      <h4>UNFETTER INSIGHT</h4>
        <p>
          An experiment in automated extraction of MITRE ATT&CK™ techniques from threat reports.  Currently, researchers and organizations produce detailed and informative reports that describe observed attacker behaviors, but these reports are presented as documents, podcasts, or conference videos.  Unfetter Insight will attempt to analyze and tag this media with associated MITRE ATT&CK™ techniques. Unfetter Insight could then simplify ingestion of threat data into Unfetter Discover or convert this media into more useful formats.
        </p>
        <h4>MITRE’S CYBER ANALYTIC REPOSITORY</h4>
        <p>
          Describing an analytic in pseudocode can allow users to adapt those universal analytics into their specific environments. You will be able to set up Unfetter for a community of interest, share and rate analytics, and note what works and what needs improvement. Unfetter is working with MITRE to develop tools that can automatically translate analytics to work in your environment for well-known systems. Splunk, MongoDB, and ElasticSearch will be the first target systems.
        </p>
        <h4>TAXII 2.0</h4>
      <p>
        Ingest and evaluate threat intelligence data using crowdsourced partner data with new TAXII 2.0 threat exchange standard. Any STIX based data can be shared between Unfetter servers or with other TAXII-aware systems.

        <h4>REST API</h4>
          <p>
            Automatically ingest complex threat data from your own systems into Unfetter through our REST API. The REST API can provide full access to individual STIX and Unfetter users’ unique survey data. You may have systems that already collect mitigation information, track threat reporting, or update sensors. Use this API to expand the possibilities of Unfetter in your environment.

        <h4>THREAT REPORTING DASHBOARDS</h4>
          <p>
            Increase sophistication and granularity of threat reporting dashboards to build new reporting for your threat team. Build reports based on Intrusion Sets, victim companies, malware outbreaks, or any combination of these elements. Know which mitigations or analytics are most effective. Create detailed and comprehensive work products for your leadership, your customers, or your InfoSec teams.
          </p>
        <h4>PURPLE TEAM OPERATIONS PLANNER</h4>
          <p>
            Increase the day-to-day effectiveness of Red and Blue Teams through Purple Team operations planning. The Purple Team Ops Planner can help your Red Team identify the MITRE ATT&CK™ techniques to focus on and identify the mitigations, sensor, or analytic gaps, conduct assessments, track Blue Team Responses, and measure improvements in detection.
