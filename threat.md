intro-paragraph: With the huge attack landscape out there, its hard to figure out which problem your organization should tackle next.  Some organizations have a team of people who spend their time researching new attack techniques, intrusion reports or scrolling through Twitter's top <b>infosec superstars</b>.  Gathering all that data into a cohesive story that is sharable, actionable, and repeatable is nearly impossible.  Spreadsheets become too unweidly.  Wiki's are great for storing inforamtion but its not actionable.  Unfetter's Threat Reporter is a workflow that will help you create, annotate, share, collaborate and make use of this Threat Report data.  


callout-title: The Threat Reporter's tool of choice. 
callout-text: Gather together reports of interest into a <b>work board</b> that helps you tell a story by letting you gather, annotate, comment and share reports from anywhere.  Sociallize your findings with fellow researchers, the SOC team or the decision makers.  Easily drive home the <i>"so what"</i> that helps your infosec teams prioritize what attack to defend against.
annotate-title: Community-driven threat research and anslysis to strengthen your network.

1-title: Customize boards to stay abreast of the latest threat activity and analysis
1-subtitle: Main Dashboard
1-text: A work board is a collection of reports that relate to a particular subject.  Look at the boards you have created, or select one from another reporter. View the individual reports, see report comments, or read longer form articles that relates to an entire board.  

2-title: Calibrate and enhance your results for maximum relevance.
2-subtitle: Create a board
2-text: Set the boundaries that will frame a board.  Maybe your board will focus on a set of intrusion sets, a particular malware family, or all attacks against a paritcular industry.  Whatever your boundaries, these help Unfetter search for similar reports it knows about, or links you with other Threat Reporters who have overlapping interests.   Boundaries can be as specific or wide ranging as you like, it simply sets the scene for the story you are trying to tell.

3-title: Receive up-to-the-minute threat reporting and analysis.
3-subtitle: Board Feed
3-text: Unfetter Discover was designed to be a collaborative, social system.  As other reporters create their own Boards, ingest new reports, or writes an article on a board you are following, that new data will show up in your board feeds.  Each piece of information could help you craft your story, but its nearly impossible to manage all that information.  The board feed puts it in your fingerprints.  A board is a living, every changing gathering of important nuggests that tell a story.  As those new reports are loaded into Unfetter, and match your boundaries, you can easily read them, incorporate them into your board, and add them to your story.

4-title: Efficiently create, source and share your own analysis and observations for sharing or reference.
4-subtitle: Write an Article
4-text: Gathering reports into some giant list is just not enough to help your customers understand the "so what?".  A detailed PDF from your favorite threat vendor tells the story they want to tell.  You need to tell your story.  A story that informs your analysts to start looking for a new attack vendor, or gives your security team the right information to start planning a new mitigation.  Or maybe your story will inform the decision makers about which security gaps need to be funded next.  That story is the center piece to your job.  Unfetter makes it easy to tell that story with a Board Article.  An article is the culmination of all the reports that have been gathered as part of the board.  The article is your story, but you can instantly link to reports, describe MITRE ATT&amp;CK&trade; techniques inline, highlight intrusion sets, malware, or analytics.  Your story needs to be a living object, so those links automatically map your article, the reports, and the board to the other workflows for Unfetter Discover.  The Analytic Developers and Network Defenders can see the fruits of your labor, in real time, as they use Unfetter Discover.
