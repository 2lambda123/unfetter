<p>When the threat hits, cyber security professionals working at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels need to work together quickly and effectively to enable a common cyber security strategy and protect against the adversary. The ability to do this in a repeatable and scalable way depends on an organization's agility to discover gaps in their security posture, understand adversary tradecraft, and communicate defensive courses of action.</p>
<p>Unfetter enhances your current assessment methodology and helps you figure out what to do next by focusing on the key relationships in your data.  Inspired by MITRE's <a href="https://car.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page">CAR</a> and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> framework, Unfetter shifts the focus beyond indicators to a more behavioral based methodology that allows you to advance your cyber security posture in a measurable and meaningful way.</p>

<h2><i class="material-icons">group</i> Leveraging the Community
<p>
    Unfetter makes it easier to get started and take advantage of community threat models like MITRE's
    <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a>. Cyber security professionals can use Unfetter to establish
    a baseline security posture, explore relationships to identify gaps, and experiment with defensive courses of action before the threat hits.

<h2><i class="material-icons">security</i> Analytics in Context
						
 						<p  align="left">Our initial prototype, <a href="https://github.com/unfetter-analytic/unfetter" target="_blank">Unfetter Analytic</a>, 
						 is a reference implementation of a platform designed to help analytic developers experiment and gain familiarity with the 
						 <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> framework as a means of measuring the effectiveness of analytics.</p>

<h2><i class="material-icons">settings</i> Discover Gaps</h2>
<p align="left">Our second prototype, <a href="https://www.github.com/unfetter-discover/unfetter" target="_blank">Unfetter Discover</a> 
    is aimed at helping the user explore additional gaps across their security posture and experiment with next steps.  The 
    initial focus is on mapping mitigations and security controls to <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> 
    and demonstrating how to explore, learn, and communicate between tactical, operational, and strategic levels of operation.
