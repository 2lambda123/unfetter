<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>Unfetter Discover runs on Docker. So, any system that supports Docker should support Unfetter Discover. Below are some instructions
    for setting up Unfetter Discover locally on a system.</p>
<br>
<h4>Mac (OSX 10.10.3+)</h4>
<li>
    <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker Community Edition</a> (version 17.06.0-ce or higher) Docker-compose is part of the installation
</li>
<li>
    <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose" target="_blank">Docker Compose</a> is installed with Community Edition
</li>
<li>Install
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac" target="_blank">Git</a> and necessary tools
</li>
<br>

<h4>Windows:</h4>
<li>
    <a href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/">Docker Toolbox</a> for
    <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Docker For Windows</a>
</li>
<li>
    <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose" target="_blank">Docker Compose</a> is installed with Docker Toolbox
</li>
<li>Follow the stnadard installation instructions for Docker Toolbox for Windows from teh Docker website. Once installed, there
    should be a Docker quickstart, Oracle VM VirtualBox, and Kitematic shortcuts on the desktop
</li>
<br>

<h4>Linux/Ubuntu:</h4>
<li>
    <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> (version 17.06.0-ce or higher)
</li>
<li>
    <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install" target="_blank">Docker Compose</a> needs to be installed separately.
</li>
<li>
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/" target="_blank">Git</a> and necessary tools
</li>
<br>

<h4>Windows 10 Pro (issues):</h4>
<p>Windows 10 Pro and Windows 2016 has native Docker support. However, it can not run the Linux based Docker containers that
    Unfetter requires. Likely, using the Docker Toolbox approach described above will work.
</p>


<h2>The Project Setup</h2>
<p>The entire application, Unfetter Discover, is made up of multiple of docker containers. Each builds upon the other. We use
    <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose" target="_blank">Docker Compose</a> to manage the startup and shutdown of all those Docker containers.
</p>
<p>The GitHub organization
    <a href="https://www.github.com/unfetter-discover">Unfetter Disocver</a> GitHub projects that logically separate the Unfetter Discover project. There are two ways to run
    Unfetter Discover:
</p>
<li>You can run all the containers from Docker Hub, without recompiling. This is recommended for most cases.</li>
<li>If you are a developer and would like to build the Unfetter-Discover project from source, then you will need to clone all
    the repos and follow the
    <a href="https://github.com/unfetter-discover/unfetter/wiki/Unfetter-Build-Types-&-Run-Modes" target="_blank">Unfetter Build Types</a>.
</li>
<br>

<h4>Case 1: Normal installation, pulling from approved Docker Hub builds</h4>
<p>In general, the Unfetter repos is the only repo you need. It has the docker-compose.yml file which will build and install
    all of Unfetter-Discover, leveraging the [Docker Hub Images](https://hub.docker.com/u/unfetter/).</p>

<p>After following the directions below, you can navigate to Unfetter Discover with Chrome or Firefox at https://localhost/</p>
<br>

<h2>Mac OSX and Linux</h2>
<pre><code>
    mkdir unfetter-discover
    cd unfetter-discover
    git clone https://github.com/unfetter-discover/unfetter.git
    cd unfetter
    docker-compose up
</code></pre>
<p>It will take few minutes for the Docker images to download and build.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h4>Windows</h4>
For Windows, Docker Toolbox will install a virtual machine through VirtualBox and execute inside of that environment. There
is a couple of steps that have to happen.
<li> Double click on the Docker Quickstart Terminal Icon on the windows. When, done, you will see a $ prompt.</li>
<li>Check the ip address of the Docker-machine now running. At the prompt, run "docker-machine.exe ip". The returning IP is the
    IP address of the docker machine, usually 192.168.99.100. NOTE: If no IP address is returned, type "docker-machine.exe
    env"
</li>
<li>Inside the docker machine, do the following</li>
<pre><code>
mkdir unfetter-discover
cd unfetter-discover
git clone https://github.com/unfetter-discover/unfetter.git
cd unfetter
docker-compose -f docker-compose.virtualbox.yml up
    </code></pre>
<h2>The Web Application</h2>
After running the docker-compose command you can view the application at: https://localhost/ Unfetter-Discover will create
certs and store them locally. You will need to accept the certificates to move forward.
