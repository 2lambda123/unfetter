<h4>Getting Involved</h4>

<p>
    Unfetter makes it easier to get started and take advantage of community threat models like MITRE's
    <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a>. Cyber security professionals can use Unfetter to establish
    a baseline security posture, explore relationships to identify gaps, and experiment with defensive courses of action before the threat hits. 
    You can read more about MITRE's efforts at the
    <a href="https://mitre.github.io/unfetter" target="_blank">MITRE GitHub Page</a>.

<p>Our initial prototype, <a href="https://github.com/unfetter-analytic/unfetter" target="_blank">Unfetter Analytic</a>, 
    is a reference implementation of a platform designed to help analytic developers experiment and gain familiarity with the 
    <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> framework as a means of measuring the effectiveness of analytics.</p>


<p>Our second prototype, <a href="https://www.github.com/unfetter-discover/unfetter" target="_blank">Unfetter Discover</a> 
    is aimed at helping the user explore additional gaps across their security posture and experiment with next steps.  The 
    initial focus is on mapping mitigations and security controls to <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> 
    and demonstrating how to explore, learn, and communicate between tactical, operational, and strategic levels of operation.
