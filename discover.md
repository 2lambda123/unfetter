<div class="col s12">The Unfetter Discover application utilizes the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-stix" target="_blank">OASIS</a> Open Standard called STIX, more specifically the <a href="https://github.com/STIXProject/specifications/wiki/Work-Product:-STIX-2.0-Specification" target="_blank">STIX 2.0</a> specification because of it's use of JSON for data representation.</div>

<div class="col s12"><p>Unfetter Discover is a locally installed web application that is focused on helping the user explore additional gaps across their security posture and experiment with the next steps. <p> Unfetter Discover focuses on mapping mitigations and security controls to Mitre's <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> and demonstrating how to explore, learn, and communicate between tactical, operation, and strategic levels of operation. By building relationships off a common framework, like ATT&CK, groups can create complex Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data and share it in meaningful ways. Unfetter Discover provides a set of dashboards, each helping visualize the relationships between the CTI data.</p><p>The Unfetter Discover application is made up of several github projects that are combined to form a seamless web application.  The general user can install the Discover application by using the pre-built docker containers found on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&page=1&pullCount=0&q=unfetter&starCount=0" target="_blank">docker hub</a>. The <a href="discover_user_install.html" target="_blank">installation instructions</a> for installing the application using the docker containers can be found under the Unfetter Discover dropdown.</p>
    <p> For more advanced users (developers), they can clone all the projects out of github and then re-build each of the docker containers from the source.  These instructions can be found under the Unfetter Discover dropdown as well.</p></div>

<h2><i class="material-icons">group</i> Leveraging the Community
<p>
    Unfetter makes it easier to get started and take advantage of community threat models like MITRE's
    <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a>. Cyber security professionals can use Unfetter to establish
    a baseline security posture, explore relationships to identify gaps, and experiment with defensive courses of action before the threat hits. 
    You can read more about MITRE's efforts at the
    <a href="https://mitre.github.io/unfetter" target="_blank">MITRE GitHub Page</a>.

<h2><i class="material-icons">security</i> Analytics in Context
						
 						<p  align="left">Our initial prototype, <a href="https://github.com/unfetter-analytic/unfetter" target="_blank">Unfetter Analytic</a>, 
						 is a reference implementation of a platform designed to help analytic developers experiment and gain familiarity with the 
						 <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> framework as a means of measuring the effectiveness of analytics.</p>

<h2><i class="material-icons">settings</i> Discover Gaps</h2>
<p align="left">Our second prototype, <a href="https://www.github.com/unfetter-discover/unfetter" target="_blank">Unfetter Discover</a> 
    is aimed at helping the user explore additional gaps across their security posture and experiment with next steps.  The 
    initial focus is on mapping mitigations and security controls to <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> 
    and demonstrating how to explore, learn, and communicate between tactical, operational, and strategic levels of operation.
