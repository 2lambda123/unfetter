When the threat hits, cyber security professionals working at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels need to work together quickly and effectively to 
enable a common cyber security strategy and protect against the adversary.  The ability to do this in a repeatable and scalable way depends on an organization's 
agility to discover gaps in their security posture, understand adversary tradecraft, and communicate defensive courses of action. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.mitre.org" target="_blank">The MITRE Corporation</a> has done significant research in this space and has a proven methodology built on their Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge 
(<a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a>) framework.  
The vision for Unfetter is to create a community-driven suite of open source tools that leverage models like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> to help cyber security professionals explore and analyze gaps 
in their security posture.  This suite of tools provides a way for users to build on insights and make informed decisions based on data driven trade space analysis.
Our initial prototype, <a href="https://www.github.com/iadgov/unfetter-analytic/wiki" target="_blank">Unfetter|Analytic</a>, is a reference implementation of a platform designed to help analytic developers experiment and gain familiarity with the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a>
framework as a means of measuring the effectiveness of analytics.

Our next prototype, <a href="https://www.github.com/iadgov/unfetter-discover/" target="_blank">Unfetter|Discover</a> is aimed at helping the user explore additional gaps across their security posture and experiment with next steps.  The initial focus is on mapping mitigations and security controls to <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> and demonstrating how to explore, learn, and communicate between tactical, operational, and strategic levels of operation.
