title: Intrusion Set Dashboard
layout: details
directory: intrusion
tagline: Access the latest global trends in adversary tradecraft and tactics.
intro-paragraph: At a glance in a single view, look at how Intrusion Sets are attacking their targets through the techniques described in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK&trade; framework.  How do their techniques overlap, which ones are outliers, and start prioritizing which hole you have to plug first.  
callout-title: The Cybersecurity Expert's tool of choice.
callout-text: Most of Unfetter Discovered applications are designed for users to research, create and share complex Cyber Threat Information.  The Intrusion Set Dashboard leverages that information to give you an "at a glance" view of which techniques are used by the intrusion sets you care about. 
annotate-title: Compare intrusion set capabilities and techniques.  
permalink: intrusion.html
1-title: Easily customize searches to view the adversaries posing the greatest threat to your network.
1-subtitle: Robust Search Capabilities
1-text: Start by selecting up to 10 of Intrusion Sets that you want to investigate.  That will be the set of intrusion sets you want to work with.  Add or remove them as you start investigating.  The main dashboard will automatically update based on your selection.  Or, start from the opposite direction.  Hover over a particular MITRE ATT&amp;CK&trade; technique and see all reported intrusion sets briefly highlight.

2-title: Discover the most common techniques in the adversary kill chain.
2-subtitle: Comparison Heat Map
2-text: The attackers you select on the left hand column have been reported using certain MITRE ATT&amp;CK&trade; technqiues. Those techniques are color coded on the main Heat Map board.  Each intrusion set is assigned a color, and the box describing that technique is lite up with those colors. If multiple intrusion sets that you selected have been reported using a particular technique, then a color gradiant identifies all the intrusion sets.  Hover over a technique and see all the reported intrusion sets, not just the ones you selected, highlight on the left hand side.

3-title: End-to-end assessment of adversary techniques to access your vulnerabilities.
3-subtitle: Uncover Courses of Action
3-text: Its important to use visualization to show data in multiple ways, to help users see things they had not seen before.  Below the heatmap, Unfetter uses a graphing tool to see how Intrusion Sets and attack technqiues are related.  Walk from intrusion set to MITRE AATT&amp;CK&trade; tactic to technique to mitigations. Walk the graph one vertice at a time to get that different view.

4-title: Receive Critical Security Controls to mitigate your vulnerability
4-subtitle: Critical Security Controls
4-text: Unfetter Discover aims to take the complex threat intelligence information and show connections you were not aware of.  Not just repeating back the inforamtion you already know, but bringing togther experts in different areas and letting them make connections together.  It does not matter what attack techniques a threat report describes, if you do not know how to stop the attack. The Intrusion Set Dashboard can tell you which documented mitigations to focus on.  Selecting the Mitigations tab will give a different view, providing a detail of the CIS Top 20 controls that should be implemented to stop the technqiues that your selected intrusion set use the most.
