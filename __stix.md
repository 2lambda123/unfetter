<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/unfetter-discover/unfetter" target="_blank">Unfetter Discover</a> project is built on the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-stix" target="_blank">OASIS Open Standard</a> called <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-stix" target="_blank">STIX</a>. STIX is a standardized language for representing structure cyber threat information. Unfetter Discover is prototyping the new <a href="https://github.com/STIXProject/specifications/wiki/Work-Product:-STIX-2.0-Specification" target="_blank">STIX 2.0</a> specification.

STIX 2.0 is great.  We can build represent rich and complex Cyber Threat Data in an approved format, available for sharing with other compliant products.  STIX 2.x is a JSON formated structure, using a REST based API called TAXII to share data among systems.  This technology fits nicely with the NodeJS based software stack in Unfetter Discover. Intending to just represent some of the data in STIX, the team eventually decided to implement all of Unfetter Discover's backend and REST interfaces fully compliant with the STIX 2.0 schema.</p>
