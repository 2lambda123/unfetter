<h4>WELCOME</h4>
<p>Unfetter Analytic s a reference implementation, inspired by The MITRE Corporation
<a href="https://car.mitre.org" target="_blank">CAR</a> and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&trade;</a>
framework, and supported by The <a href="https://www.mitre.org" target="_blank">MITRE Corporation</a>
and the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov" target="_blank">National Security Agency</a> (NSA).
</p>
<p>

<a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&trade;</a> stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques
and Common Knowledge. It is a model and framework that describes the actions an adversary may take while attacking
an enterprise network. ATT&amp;CK&trade; specifically focuses on post-exploitation of Windows host systems. Think of
it as a roadmap that lays out what an attacker COULD be doing on your network.
</p>
<p>

The <a href="https://car.mitre.org" target="_blank">CAR</a> is an effort to document and share analytic ideas and lessons
learned. Each CAR analytic is framed by the ATT&amp;CK&trade; behavior(s) it is trying to identify.
</p>
<p>
Unfetter is a project designed to help network defenders, cyber security professionals, and decision makers identify and
analyze defensive gaps in a more scalable and repeatable way. By featuring the groups
<a href="https://mitre.github.io/unfetter/#footnote1_src" target="_blank" name="footnote1_src"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
and techniques<a href="https://mitre.github.io/unfetter/#footnote1_src" target="_blank" name="footnote2_src"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
of the ATT&amp;CK&trade; model combined with the analytics, data model, and sensors of CAR, Unfetter offers an opportunity for
the community to come together and move beyond indicators toward a behavioral-based methodology.
</p>
<p>
The first release is Unfetter Analytic, a reference implementation that provides a framework for collecting events from a
client machine (Windows 7), supports building and testing analytics in the CAR model, and displays the alerts as they
reference the ATT&amp;CK&trade; model. Unfetter Analytic is not designed to be a production intrusion detection system,
but it is an educational capability for analytic developers to try, explore, and learn the concepts discussed at
